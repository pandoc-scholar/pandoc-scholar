Create beautiful, semantically enriched articles with pandoc. This
package provides utilities to make publishing of scientific articles as
simple and pleasant as possible. It simplifies setting authors' metadata
in YAML blocks, allows to add semantic annotation to citations, and only
requires the programs pandoc and make.

Overview
--------

Plain pandoc is already excellent at document conversion, but it lacks
in metadata handling. Pandoc-scholar offers simple ways to include
metadata on authors, affiliations, contact details, and citations. The
data is included into the final output as document headers. Additionally
all entries can be exported as [JSON-LD], a standardized format for the
semantic web.

The background leading to the development of pandoc-scholar is described
in the [paper published in PeerJ Computer Science][paper].

Note that since version 2.0, most of the functionality of pandoc-scholar
is now provided via [pandoc Lua filters]. If you prefer to mix-and-match
selected functionalities provided by pandoc-scholar, you can now use the
respective Lua filters directly. Integration with tools like RMarkdown
is possible this way.

### Demo

An example document plus bibliography is provided in the *example*
folder. Running `make` in the *example* folder will process the
example article, generating output like below:

[epub]: https://pandoc-scholar.github.io/example/example.epub
[JSON-LD format]: https://pandoc-scholar.github.io/example/example.jsonld

Usage via Docker
----------------

A very easy way to use pandoc-scholar is via Docker. The ready-made
images contain all necessary software to generate a paper in
multiple formats. This avoids any compatibility concerns; only
Docker is required.

The official images are in the [pandocscholar/ubuntu] and
[pandocscholar/alpine] images. The Alpine image is a bit smaller,
while the Ubuntu image may be more familiar for people looking to
extend the image. Both images come with pandoc, pandoc-citeproc,
pandoc-crossref, and LaTeX.

### Example call

Docker commands are often unwieldly due to the additional arguments.
We recommend to define an alias or short script to simplify its use.

Given an article in file `my-research-article.md` and a simple
Makefile like

```makefile
ARTICLE_FILE = my-research-article.md
OUTFILE_PREFIX = out
include $(PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH)/Makefile
```

the conversion can be performed by running

    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" -u "$(id -u)" pandocscholar/alpine

This will generate a set of files whose names all start with `out.`.
Please be aware that existing files of the same name will be
overwritten. The pandoc-scholar container calls `make` internally;
additional commands and options can be passed by appending them the
above command.

The images are based upon the official pandoc images; for more info
and usage examples, see the [pandoc/dockerfiles] GitHub repo. The
Docker images can easily be used in automatic document conversion
pipelines; [pandoc-actions-example] gives a good overview.

A major difference between pandoc and pandoc-scholar images is that
pandoc-scholar doesn't use `pandoc` but `make` as entrypoint. A
basic Makefile must be present in the article directory when running
pandoc-scholar.

Prerequisites
-------------

This package builds on [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal
document converter. See the pandoc website for [installation
instructions](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and suggestions for
LaTeX packages, which we use for PDF generation.

Starting with pandoc-scholar 3.0.0, the minimum required pandoc version
is 2.11. If you have to use an older pandoc, please combine it with the
last 2.* release of pandoc-scholar.

Also note that pandoc's JATS support, especially citation handling, was
buggy prior to pandoc v2.11.4. Please use that or a newer version when
producing JATS XML.

Installation
------------

Archives containing all required files are provided for each release.
Use the *release* button above (or directly go to the [latest release])
and download a `pandoc-scholar` archive; both archive files, `.zip` and
`.tar.gz`, contain the same files. Choose the filetype that is the
easiest to unpack on you system.

A `pandoc-scholar` folder will be created on unpacking. The folder
contains all required scripts and templates.

Usage
-----

### Quickstart

Run `make` to convert the example article into all supported output formats. The
markdown file used to create the output files can be configured via the
`ARTICLE_FILE` variable, either directly in the Makefile or by specifying the
value on the command line.

    make ARTICLE_FILE=your-file.md

### Includable Makefile

The *Makefile*, which does most of the work, is written in a style that makes it
simple to include it from within other Makefiles. This method allows to keep
`pandoc-scholar` installed in a central location and to use the same instance
for multiple projects. The `ARTICLE_FILE` and `PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH` variables
must be defined in the including Makefile:

``` Makefile
ARTICLE_FILE        = your-file.md
PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH = ../path-to-pandoc-scholar-folder
include $(PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH)/Makefile
```

Calling `make` as usual will create all configured output formats. Per default,
this creates *pdf*, *latex*, *docx*, *odt*, *epub*, *html*, and *jats* output.
The set of output files can be reduced by setting the `DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS`
variable to a subset of the aforementioned formats. For example `DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS = pdf odt docx`

Alternative template files can be set using `TEMPLATE_FILE_<FORMAT>` variables,
where `<FORMAT>` is one of *HTML*, *EPUB*, *JATS*, or *LATEX*. The reference
files for ODT and DOCX output can be changed using `ODT_REFERENCE_FILE` and
`DOCX_REFERENCE_FILE`, respectively.

Additional pandoc options can be given on a per-format basis using
`PANDOC_<FORMAT>_OPTIONS` variables. The following uses an actual Makefile as an
example to demonstrate usage of those options.

``` Makefile
ARTICLE_FILE        = open-science-formatting.md

PANDOC_LATEX_OPTIONS  = --latex-engine=xelatex
PANDOC_LATEX_OPTIONS += --csl=peerj.csl
PANDOC_LATEX_OPTIONS += --filter=pandoc-citeproc
PANDOC_LATEX_OPTIONS += -M fontsize=10pt
PANDOC_LATEX_OPTIONS += -M classoption=fleqn

PANDOC_HTML_OPTIONS   = --toc
PANDOC_EPUB_OPTIONS   = --toc

DOCX_REFERENCE_FILE   = pandoc-manuscript.docx
ODT_REFERENCE_FILE    = pandoc-manuscript.odt
TEMPLATE_FILE_LATEX   = pandoc-peerj.latex

PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH = pandoc-scholar
include $(PANDOC_SCHOLAR_PATH)/Makefile
```


Metadata Features
-----------------

Pandoc-scholar supports additional functionality via metadata fields. Most
notably, the augmentation of articles with author and affiliation data, which is
essential for academic publishing, is greatly simplified when using
pandoc-scholar.

### Authors and affiliations

Most metadata should be specified in the YAML block at the top of the article.
Author data and affiliations are taken from the *author* and *institute* field,
respectively. Institutes can be given via user-defined abbreviations, saving
unnecessary repetitions while preserving readability.

Example:

``` yaml
author:
  - James Dewey Watson:
      institute: cavendish
  - Francis Harry Compton Crick:
      institute: cavendish
institute:
  - cavendish: Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge
```

Authors are given in the order in which they are listed, while institute order
follows from author order.

The separate institute field may add unwanted complexity in some cases. It is
hence possible to omit it and to give the affiliations name directly in the
author entry:

``` yaml
author:
  - John MacFarlane:
      institute: University of California, Berkeley
```

### Institute address

Often it is not enough to give just a name for institutes. It is hence possible
to add arbitrary fields. The name must then explicitly be set via the *name*
field of the institute entry:

``` yaml
author:
  - Robert Winkler:
      institute: cinvestav
institute:
  - cinvestav:
      name: 'CINVESTAV Unidad Irapuato, Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology'
      address: 'Km. 9.6 Libramiento Norte Carr. Irapuato-León, 36821 Irapuato Gto. México'
      phone: +52 (462) 623 9635
```

Currently only the institute's address is used in the default template, but
future extensions will be based on this convention.

### Semantic citations

Understanding the reason a citations is included in scholarly articles usually
requires natural language processing of the article. However, navigating the
current literature landscape can be improved and by having that information
accesible and in a machine-readable form. Pandoc-scholar supports the CiTO
ontology, allowing authors to specify important meta-information on the citation
directly while writing the text. The property is simply prepended to the
citation key, separated by a colon: `@<property>:citationKey`.

The following table contains all supported keywords and the respective
CiTO properties. Authors are free to use the short-form, the full-length
property, or any of the alternatives listed below (i.e., all word in a
row denote the property and have the same effect).

CiTO property                  | Keyword             | alternatives
------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------
agrees\_with                   | agrees\_with        | agree\_with

includes\_quotation\_from      | quotation           | quotation\_from
